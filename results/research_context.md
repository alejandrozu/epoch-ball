- Current hypothesis: A genuinely constructive solution should come from toric/action-angle packings rather than global optimization: the standard square-slot construction gives an explicit symplectic baseline, and a richer multi-block toric 

## Latest Summary

- Worked: Implemented src/explicit_square_packing.py, an explicit toric square-slot embedding on the disjoint source union. Its predicted ratios were confirmed numerically to machine precision: for k=10 it gives mu=4 and ratio 0.6
- Did not work: The attempt still does not solve the task. Even the improved k=10 construction remains far from the near-full ratio required for small epsilon: mu=3.8 is still substantially above the full-packing threshold sqrt(10)≈3.16
- Next step: Keep the toric constructive direction but replace the singular polar chart with a smooth slit-disk or Traynor-style regularized chart, and extend the block search beyond axis-aligned rectangles to non-axis Delzant triang
